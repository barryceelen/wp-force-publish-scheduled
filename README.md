# WordPress Force Publish Scheduled Posts Plugin

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/barryceelen/wp-force-publish-scheduled.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/barryceelen/wp-force-publish-scheduled)

Publishing or unscheduling multiple scheduled posts instantly ~~used to be hard~~ is a pain.
Not any more, :tada: Rejoice!

Use the 'Publish' bulk action when viewing scheduled posts for instant satisfaction.
The 'Unschedule' bulk action will remove the scheduled date and set the selected posts' status to 'Draft'.
