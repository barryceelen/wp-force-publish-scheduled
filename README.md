# WordPress Force Publish Scheduled Posts Plugin

Unscheduling or publishing multiple scheduled posts instantly used to be hard.
Not any more :tada:.

Use the 'Publish' bulk action when viewing scheduled posts for instant satisfaction.
The 'Unschedule' bulk action will remove the scheduled date and set the selected posts' status to 'Draft'.
